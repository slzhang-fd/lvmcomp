Description: Provides stochastic EM algorithms for latent variable models
    with a high-dimensional latent space. So far, we provide functions for confirmatory item
    factor analysis based on the multidimensional two parameter logistic (M2PL) model and the 
    generalized multidimensional partial credit model. These functions scale well for problems
    with many latent traits (e.g., thirty or even more) and are virtually tuning-free.
    The computation is facilitated by multiprocessing 'OpenMP' API.
